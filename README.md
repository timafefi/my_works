Some programs that I have written throughout my programming life


Here is a description of how each program in this repository works:

1) shell.c:

This program emulates the behaviour of Linux Shell. The follwing features of the original Shell are included:
-all the usual Shell commands (using chdir() and exec() system calls)
-executing commands in backgound by adding an ampersand to the end
-executing commands in a conveyer (e.g. "ps ax | grep ...")
-input/output redirection to a file (e.g. "./prog > result < data")
